# Welcome to "Building Aaron the Intern": Generative AI Challenge Lab! üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª

Imagine you're the newest Customer Engineer at Google Cloud. Your task is helping your GCP customers make their tech work on GCP. You surely would love an intern to do the tedious technical research work for you...

But have you ever tried getting budget for something like that..?! Well, great that you live in the age of AI. So why not just building that intern yourself? Let's call "it": **"Aaron the intern"**.

This lab is designed to guide you through  GCP Generative AI, Langchain, and building real-world applications.  We'll be tackling a series of challenges, each building upon the last, to transform a basic Next.js application into a powerful AI-driven tool.

## Getting Started with GCP üöÄ

Before you embark on your Gen AI adventure, you'll need to set up your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment. Don't worry, it's easier than launching a rocket! Just follow these steps:

**1. Create or Select a GCP Project:**

*   Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), login with your credentials and select the project you have in your sandbox environment. 

**2. Your IDE and Shell in the Cloud:**
*   Open your [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/launching-cloud-shell)
*   Open youd [Cloud Shell Editor](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/launching-cloud-shell-editor)
*   This is your easiest IDE and Shell environment to work through this lab.
*   If you want to work on your local instead, feel free to.

**4. Set up GCP Project and Application Default Credentials (ADC):**

*   In the Shell set your working GCP project with `gcloud config set project <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>`.
*   The easiest way to authenticate is using Application Default Credentials (ADC). Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```


## Get the workshop Content üöÄ
**1. Fork the GitHub Repository:**
*   On GitHub create a [fork of this repository](https://github.com/jakobap/aaron/fork). 
*   Make sure to **include all branches**


**2. Clone the fork into your editing environment:**
*   Back in the Cloud Shell run `git clone <url of your forked repo>`. 


## Set Environment Variables:
**1. Env Vars in .env.local:**
-   Create a new file (in your project root) called `.env.local` based on `.env.template`
-   You will find you Gemini Api Key in [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). You might need to select "Show projects in my organization"
-   Fill out the project ID from your [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome)

**1. Env Vars in terraform.tfvars:**
-   Fill out the project ID just as you did in `.env.local`


## Deploy the required Infrastructure:

**1. Run Terraform Script:**
-   Deploy the required GCP Infrastructure with:

```
cd terraform
```

```
terraform init
```

```
terraform plan
```

```
terraform apply
```

## Running the App
After completing the steps above you should be able to run the app and access it on localhost with 
```
npm run dev
```

*Optionally, you can deploy the web app to cloud run by running `make all` in root.*


**Congratulations!** You've completed the basic GCP setup. You are now ready to explore the application and start the challenges!


# Workshop Mechaniccs

We've organized the challenges  using ** GitHub Branches** to keep things clear and manageable as you progress through the challenges.

*   **`main` Branch (Your Starting Point):** This is where you are right now! It contains the base application (and full solution!) ‚Äì  You can explore the initial setup, run the app, and get familiar with the codebase.  This branch will remain untouched as you work through the challenges. You can always come back or compare to main for the challenge solution.

*   **`001-llm-data-mining`, `002-build-knowledgebase`, `003-simple-rag-qa`, `004-advanced-rag`, `005-llm-eval-and-tracing` Branches (The Challenge Zones):**  Each of these branches represents a specific challenge in your Gen AI journey.  You'll switch to these branches to work on each challenge individually.  Think of them as separate labs, each focused on a specific skill.  Each challenge branch starts from the `main` branch, so you're always building upon a solid foundation.

**To start a challenge, you'll simply switch to its corresponding branch using Git:**

```
bash
git fetch origin
git checkout 001-llm-data-mining # For Challenge 1
git checkout 002-build-knowledgebase # For Challenge 2, and so on...
```

**Don't worry about messing things up!** Because each challenge is in its own branch, you can experiment freely. If you ever want to start fresh, you can always return to the `main` branch or reset your challenge branch back to origin (as long as you don't push your changes).




# Application Architecture üèóÔ∏è

Before you dive into the challenges, let's take a bird's-eye view of the application's architecture. This will help you understand how the different components interact.

The application follows a typical web application structure with a Next.js frontend and backend, leveraging Google Cloud services for Generative AI and data storage.

*   **Frontend (Next.js Frontend):**  This is the user interface you interact with in your browser. 

*   **Backend API (Next.js API Routes):**  These are the server-side functions that power the application, handling requests from the frontend and orchestrating the AI processes. Key API routes include:

*   **Langchain Processing Chains:**  Langchain is the framework that structures the AI workflow.

*   **Gemini API:** This service acts as an interface to Google's Gemini family of Generative AI models. It's used for:

*   **Firestore Knowledge Base (Firestore):**  This is the database where the GCP documentation is stored in chunks, along with their vector embeddings. 

*   **Vector Search Util:**  This utility handles the vector search queries against the Firestore knowledge base to retrieve relevant document chunks.

*   **Langfuse (Optional Langfuse):**  Integrated for Challenge 5, Langfuse is an OSS observability platform for LLM applications.
